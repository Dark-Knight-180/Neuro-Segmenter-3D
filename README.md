# Neuro-Segmenter-3D
This repository implements a 3D U-Net architecture for brain tumor segmentation using the BraTS 2020 dataset. It leverages multi-modal MRI scans (FLAIR, T1, T1ce, T2) and applies advanced preprocessing techniques, Dice &amp; Jaccard metrics, and BCE-Dice loss for accurate segmentation. The model achieves robust performance on volumetric medical images.
